ABSTRACT={<p>Every day cognitive and experimental researchers attempt to find evidence in support of their hypotheses in terms of statistical differences or similarities among groups. The most typical cases involve quantifying the difference of two samples in terms of their mean values using the <italic>t</italic> statistic or other measures, such as Cohen's <italic>d</italic> or <italic>U</italic> metrics. In both cases the aim is to quantify how large such differences have to be in order to be classified as notable effects. These issues are particularly relevant when dealing with experimental and applied psychological research. However, most of these standard measures require some distributional assumptions to be correctly used, such as symmetry, unimodality, and well-established parametric forms. Although these assumptions guarantee that asymptotic properties for inference are satisfied, they can often limit the validity and interpretability of results. In this article we illustrate the use of a distribution-free overlapping measure as an alternative way to quantify sample differences and assess research hypotheses expressed in terms of Bayesian evidence. The main features and potentials of the overlapping index are illustrated by means of three empirical applications. Results suggest that using this index can considerably improve the interpretability of data analysis results in psychological research, as well as the reliability of conclusions that researchers can draw from their studies.</p>}}

abstract = {Abstract Model calibration is an essential test that dynamic hypotheses must pass in order to serve as tools for decision-making. In short, it is the search for a match between actual and simulated behaviours using parameter inference. Here, we approach such an inference process from a Bayesian perspective. Under this paradigm, we provide statements about the parameters (viewed as random variables) and data in probabilistic terms. These statements stem from a posterior distribution whose solution is often found via statistical simulation. However, the uptake of these methods within the system dynamics field has been somewhat limited, and state-of-the-art algorithms have not been explored. Therefore, we introduce Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), an efficient algorithm that outperforms random-walk methods in exploring complex parameter spaces. We apply HMC to calibrate an SEIR model and frame the process within a practical workflow. In doing so, we also recommend visualisation tools that facilitate the communication of results. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo method to estimate unknown quantities through sample generation from a target distribution for which an analytical solution is difficult. The strength of this method lies in its geometrical foundations, which render it efficient for traversing high-dimensional spaces. First, this paper analyses the performance of HMC in calibrating five variants of inputs to an age-structured SEIR model. Four of these variants are related to restriction assumptions that modellers devise to handle high-dimensional parameter spaces. The other one corresponds to the unrestricted symmetric variant. To provide a robust analysis, we compare HMC’s performance to that of the Nelder–Mead algorithm (NMS), a common method for non-linear optimisation. Furthermore, the calibration is performed on synthetic data in order to avoid confounding effects from errors in model selection. Then, we explore the variation in the method’s performance due to changes in the scale of the problem. Finally, we fit an SEIR model to real data. In all the experiments, the results show that HMC approximates both the synthetic and real data accurately, and provides reliable estimates for the basic reproduction number and the age-dependent transmission rates. HMC’s performance is robust in the presence of underreported incidences and high-dimensional complexity. This study suggests that stringent assumptions on age-dependent transmission rates can be lifted in favour of more realistic representations. The supplementary section presents the full set of results.}

    abstract = { The basic reproduction number, ℜ0, is of paramount importance in the study of infectious disease dynamics. Primarily, ℜ0 serves as an indicator of the transmission potential of an emerging infectious disease and the effort required to control the invading pathogen. However, its estimates from compartmental models are strongly conditioned by assumptions in the model structure, such as the distributions of the latent and infectious periods (epidemiological delays). To further complicate matters, models with dissimilar delay structures produce equivalent incidence dynamics. Following a simulation study, we reveal that the nature of such equivalency stems from a linear relationship between ℜ0 and the mean generation time, along with adjustments to other parameters in the model. Leveraging this knowledge, we propose and successfully test an alternative parametrization of the SEIR model that produces accurate ℜ0 estimates regardless of the distribution of the epidemiological delays, at the expense of biases in other quantities deemed of lesser importance. We further explore this approach’s robustness by testing various transmissibility levels, generation times and data fidelity (overdispersion). Finally, we apply the proposed approach to data from the 1918 influenza pandemic. We anticipate that this work will mitigate biases in estimating ℜ0. }

abstract = {Abstract Methods for confidence interval estimation and hypothesis testing used in the literature and implemented in system dynamics software packages typically assume that the data are normally distributed, not autocorrelated and not heteroskedastic. In dynamic models these assumptions are often violated. Here we propose the bootstrapping method for confidence interval estimation and hypothesis testing in system dynamics models and provide an overview of the issues involved in applying bootstrapping properly in dynamic models. Bootstrapping is a widely used and robust method but its use in system dynamics models is rare. Bootstrapping can handle violations of the maintained assumptions of traditional methods. It is also valid for small samples whereas traditional methods are valid only asymptotically. Another advantage of bootstrapping is that it is a convenient tool for testing hypotheses including complicated functions of parameters (e.g., multiplication, division of parameters). We provide two examples for illustration, one in discrete time and one in continuous time, including experimental data from the beer distribution game and field data from a study of service quality in the banking industry.

We build one such model and estimate it for all 92 nations with reliable testing data. Cumulative cases and deaths through 22 December 2020 are estimated to be 7.03 and 1.44 times official reports, yielding an infection fatality rate (IFR) of 0.51 percent, which has been declining over time. Absent adherence fatigue, cumulative cases would have been 47 percent lower. Scenarios through June 2021 show that modest improvement in responsiveness could reduce cases and deaths by about 14 percent, more than the impact of vaccinating half of the population by that date. Variations in responsiveness to risk explain two orders of magnitude difference in per-capita deaths despite reproduction numbers fluctuating around one across nations.

We conduct two complementary studies to assess model features supporting better long-term predictions. First, we leverage the diverse models contributing to the CDC repository of COVID-19 USA death projections to identify factors associated with prediction accuracy across different projection horizons. We find that better long-term predictions correlate with: (1) capturing the physics of transmission (instead of using black-box models); (2) projecting human behavioral reactions to an evolving pandemic; and (3) resetting state variables to account for randomness not captured in the model before starting projection. Second, we introduce a very simple model, SEIRb, that incorporates these features, and few other nuances, offers informative predictions for as far as 20-weeks ahead, with accuracy comparable with the best models in the CDC set. Key to the long-term predictive power of multi-wave COVID-19 trajectories is capturing behavioral responses endogenously: balancing feedbacks where the perceived risk of death continuously changes transmission rates through the adoption and relaxation of various Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs).},

To explore the causes of these cycles we develop a behavioral dynamic model of the airline industry with endogenous capacity expansion, demand, pricing, and other feedbacks; and model several strategies industry actors have employed in efforts to mitigate the cycle. We estimate model parameters by maximum likelihood methods during both partial model tests and full model estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to establish confidence intervals. Contrary to prior work we find that the delay in aircraft acquisition (the supply line of capacity on order) is not a very influential determinant of the profit cycle. Instead we find that aggressive use of yield management—varying prices to ensure high load factors (capacity utilization)—may have the unintended effect of increasing earnings variance by increasing the sensitivity of profit to changes in demand.
