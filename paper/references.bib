ABSTRACT={<p>Every day cognitive and experimental researchers attempt to find evidence in support of their hypotheses in terms of statistical differences or similarities among groups. The most typical cases involve quantifying the difference of two samples in terms of their mean values using the <italic>t</italic> statistic or other measures, such as Cohen's <italic>d</italic> or <italic>U</italic> metrics. In both cases the aim is to quantify how large such differences have to be in order to be classified as notable effects. These issues are particularly relevant when dealing with experimental and applied psychological research. However, most of these standard measures require some distributional assumptions to be correctly used, such as symmetry, unimodality, and well-established parametric forms. Although these assumptions guarantee that asymptotic properties for inference are satisfied, they can often limit the validity and interpretability of results. In this article we illustrate the use of a distribution-free overlapping measure as an alternative way to quantify sample differences and assess research hypotheses expressed in terms of Bayesian evidence. The main features and potentials of the overlapping index are illustrated by means of three empirical applications. Results suggest that using this index can considerably improve the interpretability of data analysis results in psychological research, as well as the reliability of conclusions that researchers can draw from their studies.</p>}}

abstract = {Abstract Model calibration is an essential test that dynamic hypotheses must pass in order to serve as tools for decision-making. In short, it is the search for a match between actual and simulated behaviours using parameter inference. Here, we approach such an inference process from a Bayesian perspective. Under this paradigm, we provide statements about the parameters (viewed as random variables) and data in probabilistic terms. These statements stem from a posterior distribution whose solution is often found via statistical simulation. However, the uptake of these methods within the system dynamics field has been somewhat limited, and state-of-the-art algorithms have not been explored. Therefore, we introduce Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), an efficient algorithm that outperforms random-walk methods in exploring complex parameter spaces. We apply HMC to calibrate an SEIR model and frame the process within a practical workflow. In doing so, we also recommend visualisation tools that facilitate the communication of results. © 2021 The Authors.

    abstract = { We reflect on epidemiological modeling conducted throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in Western Europe, specifically in Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Western Europe was initially one of the worst-hit regions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Western European countries deployed a range of policy responses to the pandemic, which were often informed by mathematical, computational, and statistical models. Models differed in terms of temporal scope, pandemic stage, interventions modeled, and analytical form. This diversity was modulated by differences in data availability and quality, government interventions, societal responses, and technical capacity. Many of these models were decisive to policy making at key junctures, such as during the introduction of vaccination and the emergence of the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants. However, models also faced intense criticism from the press, other scientists, and politicians around their accuracy and appropriateness for decision making. Hence, evaluating the success of models in terms of accuracy and influence is an essential task. Modeling needs to be supported by infrastructure for systems to collect and share data, model development, and collaboration between groups, as well as two-way engagement between modelers and both policy makers and the public. }

abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo method to estimate unknown quantities through sample generation from a target distribution for which an analytical solution is difficult. The strength of this method lies in its geometrical foundations, which render it efficient for traversing high-dimensional spaces. First, this paper analyses the performance of HMC in calibrating five variants of inputs to an age-structured SEIR model. Four of these variants are related to restriction assumptions that modellers devise to handle high-dimensional parameter spaces. The other one corresponds to the unrestricted symmetric variant. To provide a robust analysis, we compare HMC’s performance to that of the Nelder–Mead algorithm (NMS), a common method for non-linear optimisation. Furthermore, the calibration is performed on synthetic data in order to avoid confounding effects from errors in model selection. Then, we explore the variation in the method’s performance due to changes in the scale of the problem. Finally, we fit an SEIR model to real data. In all the experiments, the results show that HMC approximates both the synthetic and real data accurately, and provides reliable estimates for the basic reproduction number and the age-dependent transmission rates. HMC’s performance is robust in the presence of underreported incidences and high-dimensional complexity. This study suggests that stringent assumptions on age-dependent transmission rates can be lifted in favour of more realistic representations. The supplementary section presents the full set of results.}

    abstract = { The basic reproduction number, ℜ0, is of paramount importance in the study of infectious disease dynamics. Primarily, ℜ0 serves as an indicator of the transmission potential of an emerging infectious disease and the effort required to control the invading pathogen. However, its estimates from compartmental models are strongly conditioned by assumptions in the model structure, such as the distributions of the latent and infectious periods (epidemiological delays). To further complicate matters, models with dissimilar delay structures produce equivalent incidence dynamics. Following a simulation study, we reveal that the nature of such equivalency stems from a linear relationship between ℜ0 and the mean generation time, along with adjustments to other parameters in the model. Leveraging this knowledge, we propose and successfully test an alternative parametrization of the SEIR model that produces accurate ℜ0 estimates regardless of the distribution of the epidemiological delays, at the expense of biases in other quantities deemed of lesser importance. We further explore this approach’s robustness by testing various transmissibility levels, generation times and data fidelity (overdispersion). Finally, we apply the proposed approach to data from the 1918 influenza pandemic. We anticipate that this work will mitigate biases in estimating ℜ0. }
